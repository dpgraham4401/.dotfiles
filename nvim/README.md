## Neovim ##
I keep my neovim set up relatively minimal. with that being said, here's a list of complicated stuff.

## GitHub Copilot
tpope has a great plugin here
https://github.com/github/copilot.vim

It has almost no config, but does require manual setup (as I have things set up), 
just use tab to accecpt suggestions.

## Completions
I have two important key mappings for selecting completions suggested by LSP and whatever else, 
1. Control-Space -> use next completion suggestions
2. Control-Shift-Space -V use the previos completion suggestion
